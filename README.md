## Summary

MapleSeed is a program initially created on a Windows system for personal use to help me obtain Wii U game files over the internet. There was another program that did something similar, but it was too complicated and bloated for my taste, and since I was enjoyed writing programs and wished to enhance my skillset, I decided to fix my own problem. Thus MapleSeed was born. At first it was never intended to be a publically available program. Back during a time when private repos on github weren't free. So, obviously, the code had to be public. Eventually people started running across it, apparently due to a random russian website/user that happened upon it and started spreading the repo link across the internet. I started getting requests on how to compile it. Which wasn't exactly an easy task back then because it was for personal use. So the build environment was.... messy to say the least. So I made it easier, and started providing binary builds. I shared it a few times, and as the rest say, is history. It wasn't extremely popular due to it's very hit or miss nature when it came to decrypting the content obtained. But it worked well enough for people to continue requesting builds of it across the internet on various websites. I no longer have a Windows based machine, as I've switched entirely to the Apple ecosystem(a decison I mildy regret in terms of gaming, but more than worth it for the productivity it provides in comparison to Windows). So, seeing that Cemu is now slowly but surely being built for macOS systems(yay!!!!), and that I've started getting posts on reddit and emails here and there requesting a mac build. Here we are. This program, or well, I should say, app. Is a work in progress. MapleSeed-macOS is being rebuilt from the ground up.
